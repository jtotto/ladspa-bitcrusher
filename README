NOTE:  I have NOT requested the uuid the plugin is currently using from the central uuid
-issuing authority.  I wrote this as a learning experience and don't want to clutter up
the I.D. space.  If you're using it, just use the tools provided by the LADSPA SDK to 
make sure that you don't have whichever plugin has the same id installed, or you'll have
a conflict.

This is a very, VERY basic implementation of quantization distortion as a LADSPA plugin.
I intend also to implement decimation.
When writing it I referred heavily to the example plugins provided by the LADSPA SDK, 
as well as to some of the excellent plugins from http://plugin.org.uk/.  

To build, you need only have ladspa.h available. (the LADSPA SDK may be helpful, but isn't necessary)

I wrote the makefile by hand; it's not very sophisticated.  Basically, make sure that the build
steps outlined by http://gdam.ffem.org/ladspa-doc/ladspa-3.html section 3.5 are followed and 
that the resulting shared library ends up wherever your plugin host will be looking for it.

Should be as simple as make, make install.
